## CNC CAM System
A CNC CAM system, also known as CAM software, is a vital component of CNC machining. It stands for Computer-Aided Manufacturing and transforms CAD designs into CNC machine instructions.
This process involves CAD design, CAM programming to generate toolpaths and instructions, and CNC machining where the machine executes these instructions.
CAM systems are crucial for automating manufacturing, reducing errors, and ensuring precision in industries like aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing.
